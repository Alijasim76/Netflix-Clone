# Netflix-Clone <br>
 This Netflix Clone is my first ever web development project, and it marks the beginning of my journey into the world of frontend development. Building this project helped me understand how real-world websites are structured and how design and functionality come together to create a smooth user experience.

In this project, I focused on recreating the UI and layout inspired by Netflix, including sections like the hero banner, movie rows, and responsive design elements. I worked with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, which strengthened my core web development fundamentals.

While developing this clone, I learned a lot about responsive layouts, flexbox, positioning, reusable components, and clean UI design. I also faced challenges, but solving them improved my problem-solving skills and boosted my confidence as a beginner developer.

This project may be simple, but for me, it represents growth, consistency, and the courage to start. It motivated me to keep learning, build more projects, and move step-by-step toward becoming a skilled web developer.
